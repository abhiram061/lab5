                <h1>5.Memento</h1>
                <img src="Memento.jpeg" alt="Director:Christopher Nolan" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">                    <p>
                        Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in this inventive, backwards 2001 thriller from writer-director Christoper Nolan, 
                        which tells the story of a vengeful man who suffers from short-term memory loss. Memento unfolds in ten-minute sequences, shown in reverse 
                        chronological order, creating an experience that put Nolan on everyone's short-list, and turned Memento into one of the privileged
                        few movies that become lexicon. Not only is it a great thriller film, it's also one of the best mystery thriller movies of all time.

                <p>
                        Even though everyone knows the big twist in the sixth sense now, M. Night Shyamalan's 
                        breakthrough 1999 movie, starring Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, is still one of the
                        best thriller movies that stands firm even without the shock and awe of its final moments. 
                        Haley Joel Osment's journey as young Cole, a tortured boy desperate to find out why the dead 
                        appear to him,is masterful storytelling, containing a meaningful message about embracing 
                        that which terrifies you to discover the truth underneath.
